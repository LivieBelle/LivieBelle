# Hi, I'm Livie
- I am a senior in high school, and I'm basically graduating in December.
- I did Irish Dance for 5 years, and I had to stop due to Covid.
- My favorite food is homemade alfredo, where the sauce and pasta is made from scratch.
- I don't actually want to to be in this class. I just need it to graduate.
- I really love Cavetown, and I saw him live in a concert.
